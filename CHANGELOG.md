Implemented equipment from my primary homebrew document. Includes firearms, attachements and ammunition for firearms, and improved armor and shields (one for each tier).

## Equipment

### Armor

Advanced armor variants for light, medium, and heavy armor tiers. Added an option for a shield for both light and heavy armor with their own unique benefits.

- Mountain Plate (Heavy Armor)
- Skirmisher's Shield (Light Armor shield)
- Tower Shield (Heavy Armor shield)

### Firearm Attachments
