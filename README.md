## Content Plans

To see the full list of planned content, I have published a [single comprehrensive document on homebrewery.](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/A4VYfH4m84o8) As this is a living document, it will see updates faster than this foundry module. However, the goal is to have the two of them synced-up in terms of content.

## Credits

Special credit to [this short-but-sweet supplement for the Poisoner's Kit](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/188571/Poisoners-Kit-Guide) provided by Morgan Boetsma on Dungeon Master's Guild. They were the inspiration behind my original Poisoner's Kit homebrew supplement, which heavily modified and expanded upon their original ruleset. Without this work, my poison crafting rules would not exist, nor would any of the tool kit supplements which branched out of it.
